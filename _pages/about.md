I am Kaiwen Shi, currently a rising senior at Vanderbilt University. I am interested in general mathematics and how it manifests in machine learning algorithms. I am now learning optimal transport theory with Dr.Soheil Kolouri.

The website now is still preliminary. Ignore everything in the projects and publictions sections as they are only templates.

Contact me anytime.
