I am Kaiwen Shi, a graduate of Vanderbilt University. I am interested in general mathematics and how it manifests in machine learning algorithms. I am also particularly interested in how machine learning and deep learning could benefit biomedical researches such as drug discovery. I have been working with Dr. Soheil Kolouri and Dr. Akram Aldroubi on Optimal Transport Theory.
