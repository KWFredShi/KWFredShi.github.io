I used to like architecture a lot and I aspired to become a trained archtiect. In a summer camp, I enrolled in an architecture practice class and in its capstone project, I was tasked to explore an underground place.

So I created an underground public space, where people could socialize, read, or simply enjoy the breeze. The concrete bars symbolized tree trunks, but there were no leaves; instead, the tiny glass-sealed pores let sunlight in, creating a shadow of light around the bars.

When the people above walked around, the shadow of lights moved accordingly. Come in and feel the underground breeze.
