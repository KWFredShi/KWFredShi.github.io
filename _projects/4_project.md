This was a class project, so it might contain some designs that seem irrelevant to a toy store. **I retain all the rights.**

# Imitatio

The imitatio task was given to us as a primer for further designs. We had to follow a master's style and create a piece in that style. **Guess whom I followed?**

# Logos

From here on, everything will be related to TimeCapsule designs. First, the logos:

It looked nice to me, but to be completely transparent, it was a **compromised result**. The original design fused the words **Time** and **Capsule** into a capsule shape, which I preferred the most. However, it was eventually turned down by the client.

# Posters & Posts

We designed both **posters** and **social media posts** for in-person and online promotions. A sketch of the poster looked like this:

We then **digitalized it** into:

Another very cute sketch, which unfortunately did not make it to the final design:

We also created **several Instagram post materials**! For example, this one was designed for an **announcement**:

The client also asked for a **pop-art styled post**, so we **imitated Roy Lichtenstein's style** and came up with this:

This one takes a more **minimalist** approach:
