This was a class project, so it might contain some designs that seem irrelevant to toy store. I retain all the rights.

# Imitatio

The imitatio task was given to us as a primer for further designs. We must follow some master's style and make a piece out of it. Guess whom I followed?

# Logos

Here on will be contributed only to TimeCapsule designs. The first will be the logos.

It looked nice to me, but to be completely transparent it was a compromised result. The original design infused the words Time and Capsule into a Capsule shape, which I preferred the most. However, it was eventually turned down by the client.

# Posters & Posts

We designed for the client both posters and posts for in-person and online promotes. A sketch of the poster looked like:

We digitalized it into:

Another very cute sketch, which again unfortunately did not make it to the end, followed:

We also made a lot of post materials for Instagram! For example, this one was designed for making an announcement:

The client asked for a pop-styled post as well, so we imitated after Roy Lichtenstein and came up with this:

This one is more minimalist:
